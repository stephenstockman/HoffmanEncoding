# HuffmanEncoding
Simple Java based program to convert txt files into a comressed format. This program has a GUI interface to allow the user to select atxt file and compress it. This file then creates two other files one is a key file and the other is a comressed shs file. The shs file is a binary file created with bitwise manipulation expressing the string found within the txt file under the guidlines followed by a Huffman tree. The key file also acts as a form of encrytion as a user needs both the key file and the shs file to decompress and return the original txt. To decompress select the shs file with the key file in the same directory and press decompress within the GUI.
